# Type Casting

1. Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
   byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
2. Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
   double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
