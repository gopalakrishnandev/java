# class - private, setter and getter

# package

# methods

# constructor

# static members

# data type

1. primitive type - immutable
2. non-primitive type - muttable (String, Array, Class...)

# basic math operators

# Arithmetic operators

(+, -, \*, /, %)

# Assignment operators

(=, +=, -=, \*=, /=, %=)

# Unary operators

# Relational operators

( ==, !=, >, <, <=, >=)

# String

non-primitive (non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.)

# Type Casting

1. Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
   byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
2. Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
   double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

# Array

1. type[] name = {value, value};
2. index starts from 0

# Object

1. first need to create class
2. create an object with new keyword and specified class
3. object contains primitive value and non primitive
4. object contains objects

# Stack and heap

# PassbyValue

1. primitive - primitives are immutable, when the copied value gets changed, the original is not affected.
2. Copying object reference -objects are not immutable,changing the object with copied reference is changing the object.

# if else

# Methods

1. return type
2. invoke method
3. argument list must match with argument list

# access modifiers

1. public -Access anywhere within the program
2. private -Access anywhere in the same class
3. protected -Access anywhere the same package and its subclasses outside the package
4. default -Access anywhere within the same package
